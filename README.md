# Angular8 CRUD

My strategy was to first understand the requirements and the Angular framework.
Next was to find a tutorial project that implements Angular client and WebAPI with EF. 
From here I can combine the understanding and the practical implementation of the project.

Todo: 
 1. Make a new admin.component that displays on a separate page. 
 2. From admin.component create add/update/delete/read
 3. Edit main page so it displays two component view where course categories is listed and user are
  able to click on user to populate details into form. In main page the user should not be able to
  edit categories or details.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.18.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
